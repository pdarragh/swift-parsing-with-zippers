The *basic types* are mostly type aliases meant to lend more semantically
oriented names to the types from which everything else is built. The exception
to this is the `ReferenceArray`, which is a simple class built around Swift's
built-in array type. The `ReferenceArray` provides a mechanism for giving
reference semantics to what is otherwise a value type.
